# Oscillator Physics Simulation

This Contains Basic Python Oscillator Simulations (As a supplement to a current physics project I am working on) Using the p5 and matplotlib libraries for graphics as well as the Rungeâ€“Kutta method

#### Bugs/Fixes/Updates: 
> Will Fix Bug With Coupled Pendulum In Near Future!
> </br> Many More Oscillators To Be Added Soon!
