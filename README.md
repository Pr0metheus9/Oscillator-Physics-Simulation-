# Oscillator Physics Simulation

This Contains Basic Python Oscillator Simulations (As a supplement to a current physics project I am working on) Using the p5 and matplotlib libraries for graphics. Calculations are done using the Rungeâ€“Kutta method

* Sorry for crap code, will fix soon (only had a couple of hours to work on it)

#### Bugs/Fixes/Updates/Notes: 
> Fix Bug With Coupled Pendulum In Near Future! </br>
> Add a father oscillator class that all oscillators will inherit from. </br>
> Many More Oscillators To Be Added Soon! </br>
